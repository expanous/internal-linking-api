# Step 3: Title Analysis and Recommendations

## Project Overview

I'd like to write an article on behalf of Capital.com that ranks for the keyword **"Best crypto trading strategies"**.

## Example Tone and Style

This is an example of the tone and style I want for the title:

**ADA price prediction 2025: Is Cardano a good investment?**  
*Third-party price target*

## Top-Ranking Article Titles

| Rank | Title |
|------|-------|
| 1 | The Best 5 Crypto Trading Strategies \| IG Bank Switzerland |
| 2 | A Beginner's Guide to Day Trading Crypto - Gemini |
| 3 | Master Advanced Crypto Trading Strategies for 2025 |
| 4 | 6 Crypto Day Trading Strategies & Tips for Beginners |

## Analysis Request

Please analyze the "angle" or content type of the top ranking articles. Analyze if the article should be a "how to" guide, a "what is" definition, a listicle, or another type of content. What are tonal or other patterns you notice? Why are these titles ranking? Then, give me some recommended titles to rank competitively only. Keep in mind it is 2025.

### Examples of Recommended Titles
