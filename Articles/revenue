<h2>Types of revenue</h2>

<p>There are many different ways companies can distinguish revenue. One revenue example &nbsp;could be a company may divide it according to the divisions that generate it. For example, a car manufacturer may classify revenue across different vehicle models or vehicle types (SUV vs truck).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organisations may also distinguish revenue between tangible and intangible. For example, Apple (<a href="/en-int/markets/shares/apple-inc-share-price">AAPL</a>) may look at revenue from the iPad and Apple watch, which is tangible, as separate from its Apple Music or Apple TV+ revenue, which is intangible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revenue can also be divided into operating revenue, which is sales from the company’s core business and non-operating revenue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Formula for calculating revenue</h2>

<p>There are also standard ways to calculate net revenue. Some companies do not accept returns, and a retailer may use a different formula than a service company, but the formula below is the one most commonly used is the net revenue is the quantity of items sold, multiplied by the unit price, minus and discounts, allowances and/or returns.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Net revenue " class="picture-container-wide" src="https://img.capital.com/glossary/What-is-Revenue_MCT-8831_EN.png" title="Net revenue " /></p>

<p>The first element is the quantity sold, this is then multiplied by the price, for a retailer, this could be the fact they sold 100 shirts in 12 months. Multiplied by the unit price of a shirt which is $10, and then minus any discounts, allowances or returns that have been given on that particular brand of shirt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some limitations with this formula. The first is that if the company has a diversified product line, the net formula would have to be calculated for each product or service and then added together to get the company’s total revenue.</p>

<h2>Factors that affect revenue</h2>

<p>There are several factors that affect revenue in economics, the first is market demand. The level of demand for a company’s services or products is an important factor in revenue. High demand tends to mean high revenue and low demand could mean a poor revenue result.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below are some other factors that affect revenue:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Competition</strong>. Other companies in the same sector can affect your company revenue. Often the more competition, the more difficult it is to generate revenue.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Pricing</strong>. The products and services’ price is also important in determining revenue. If the price is too high, customers may go elsewhere. However, if it is too low, the company may not generate enough revenue to cover costs.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Marketing and advertising</strong>. Effective advertising and marketing can increase a company’s revenue and attract sales from new and existing customers.&nbsp;</p>

	<p><strong>Economic conditions</strong>. During times of economic growth, companies may see increased revenue, while in times of economic downturns revenue may decrease.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Product quality</strong>. The quality of a company’s products and services can impact revenue. If the <aproducts are of low quality, it can turn customers away, thus decreasing revenue. If the quality is high, this may attract customers to your services/product.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ol>
