<p><strong><a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/trade-definition">Exchange</a> traded <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">fund</a></strong> (<strong><a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a></strong>) is a useful instrument in an <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/trader-definition">investor</a>’s arsenal. Yet what’s the mechanics behind this investing vehicle and how do the <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a> work? Here we take a look at the ETF definition. </p>
<h2>What is an <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a>?</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/trade-definition">exchange</a> traded <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">fund</a> (<a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a>) is a fund designed to track a particular group of <a href="https://capital.com/share-definition">shares</a>, <a href="https://capital.com/bond-definition">bonds</a>, <a href="https://capital.com/commodity-definition">commodities</a>, <a href="https://capital.com/derivative-definition">derivative</a> products or other <a href="https://capital.com/asset-definition">assets</a>. In essence, an <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a> is a basket of <a href="https://capital.com/securities-definition">securities</a> that trades on an <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/trade-definition">exchange</a>. </p>

<h2>How do <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a> work </h2>
<p>An <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a> is a type of <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">fund</a> that is based on various <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/asset-definition">assets</a>, such as stocks, <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/bond-definition">bonds</a>, <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/commodity-definition">commodities</a> and others, and divides ownership of itself into <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/share-definition">shares</a> that are held by <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/shareholder-definition">shareholders</a>. The details of the ETF structure usually vary by country or even region of a country.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/shareholder-definition">shareholders</a> indirectly own the <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/asset-definition">assets</a> of the <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">fund</a>, and they will typically get an annual report. Shareholders are entitled to a <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/share-definition">share</a> of the profits, such as <a href="https://capital.com/dividend-definition">dividends</a> or <a href="https://capital.com/interest-rates-definition">interest</a>, and they may get a residual value in case the <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">fund</a> is liquidated. Their ownership interest in the fund can easily be sold and bought.</p>
<p><a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a> don’t redeem or sell their individual <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/share-definition">shares</a> at net <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/asset-definition"><a a="" hr<="">ef="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/asset-valuation-definition"&gt;asset value</a> (</a><a href="https://capital.com/nav-net-asset-value-definition">NAV</a>). Instead, financial institutions purchase and redeem <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a> <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/share-definition">shares</a> directly from the ETF, but only in large blocks, known as creation units. </p>
<p>The ability to purchase and redeem creation units gives <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a> an <a href="https://capital.com/arbitrage-definition">arbitrage </a>mechanism intended to minimise the potential deviation between the <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/market-price-definition">market price</a> and the NAV of <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a> <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/share-definition">shares</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a> vs <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">mutual <a a="" hr<="">ef="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/investment-fund-definition"&gt;funds</a></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://capital.com/mutual-fund-definition">Mutual funds</a> and <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a> are both baskets of <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/transferable-securities-definition">securities</a>, yet the way the two instruments <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/trade-definition">trade</a> is significantly different. </p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">mutual <a a="" hr<="">ef="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/investment-fund-definition"&gt;funds</a>, you can </a><a href="https://capital.com/trade-etfs">trade ETFs</a> on <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/share-definition">stock</a> exchanges at any time during the <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/trade-definition">trading</a> session, rather than once at the end of the day. An <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a> meaning is that of marketable <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/collateral-definition">security</a>, which means that its price will change throughout the trading day.</p>
<p><a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">Mutual <a a="" hr<="">ef="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/investment-fund-definition"&gt;funds</a>, on the other hand, can only be bought at the end of the end of the <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/trade-definition">trading</a> day after markets close.</a></p>
<h2>Different types of <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a> explained</h2>
<p>There are various <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a> types <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/financial-market-participants-definition">investors</a> and traders can choose from. These types can be based on the <a href="https://capital.com/asset-classes-definition">asset class</a> of the <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETF</a>’s components, their geography, industry selection, and other themes. </p>

<h3>Active vs Passive <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a> explained</h3>
<p>Passive <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a> typically track an <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/index-definition">index</a>, hence the components of a passive ETFs will always reflect its benchmark. Index-tracking ETFs can be used as a form of <a href="https://capital.com/passive-investing-definition">passive investing</a>, a hands-off approach where <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/financial-market-participants-definition">investors</a> rely on broader benchmark performance to generate <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/returns-definition">returns</a> on their portfolios.</p>
<p>Active <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/etf-definition">ETFs</a>, on the other hand, typically involve an investment manager, who pro-actively chooses the <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">fund</a>’s components to beat a benchmark (generate higher <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/returns-definition">returns</a>), and is a form of <a href="https://capital.com/active-investing-definition">active investing</a>. Active <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/investment-fund-definition">funds</a> may involve a higher management fee since there is an actual investment professional managing a <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/mutual-fund-definition">fund</a>. </p>
