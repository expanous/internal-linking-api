A <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/policy-mix-definition">policy mix</a> refers to a combination of fiscal and <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/monetary-policy-definition">monetary policies</a> that a country implements to manage its economy.  

Implementing a <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/policy-mix-definition">policy mix</a> means the country’s central bank and elected government will adopt different strategies and tools at the same time to accomplish shared goals.

How a <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/policy-mix-definition">policy mix</a> works
A country’s economic policy consists of its fiscal and <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/monetary-policy-definition">monetary policy</a>. In most democratic countries, the elected government legislatures are in charge of fiscal policy, while independent central banks manage <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/monetary-policy-definition">monetary policy</a>. In the US, the central bank is known as the Federal Reserve (the Fed).

Although the government legislatures and central banks are from two different branches, they often <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/share-definition">share</a> a common set of goals, such as low unemployment rate, healthy economic growth, moderate <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/interest-rates-definition">interest rates</a> and stable prices.

Through fiscal policy, the government will determine the level of spending and taxation to influence the country’s economic conditions, such as aggregate demand for <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/commodity-definition">goods</a> and services, employment, <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/inflation-definition">inflation</a> and economic growth.

The <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/monetary-policy-definition">monetary policy</a> is shaped by a country’s central bank, which controls the overall <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/supply-definition">supply</a> of money and credit available to banks, consumers and businesses. The main tool available to central banks is <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/interest-rates-definition">interest rates</a>. If the central bank increases <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/interest-rates-definition">interest rates</a>, it will likely encourage savings and reduce borrowing and spending. In contrast, a lower <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/interest-rates-definition">interest rate</a> will likely encourage borrowing from businesses, including for mortgages for home buyers. A lower <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/interest-rates-definition">interest rate</a> may incentivise investment by businesses as the cost of borrowing falls.

Example of a <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/policy-mix-definition">policy mix</a>
Policy mixing has been repeatedly adopted as a measure to tackle economic crises throughout the 21st century. During the 2008 financial crisis in the US, the rising <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/interest-rates-definition">interest rates</a> led to a mass default on subprime mortgages, eventually culminating in the collapse of the housing market in the country. The effect of the collapsed housing market spilled over to the broader <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/capital-market-definition">financial market</a>, leading to a recession.

In response to the economic crisis, the central bank eased <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/monetary-policy-definition">monetary policy</a> by cutting <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/interest-rates-definition">interest rates</a>, while fiscal policy makers implemented years of austerity measures, such as cutting government spending.

As fiscal policy makers are elected legislators, in <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/order-definition">order</a> to win support, their decisions can be influenced by popular sentiments. For example, governments may increase spending despite a tight labour market and high <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/inflation-definition">inflation</a> or cut taxes. This will in turn compel the central bank to raise <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/interest-rates-definition">interest rates</a> to counter the effect of those fiscal policies.   

The Covid-19 pandemic
The Covid-19 pandemic, which started in early 2020, caused huge economic damages globally, as countries implemented months of lockdown measures, which led to drastically reduced productivity and disrupted <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/supply-definition">supply</a> chains.

In response to the crisis, the US and many EU countries’ fiscal and monetary policymakers coordinated to provide economic stimulus by cutting <a href="https://capital.com//en-int/learn/glossary/interest-rates-definition">interest rates</a>, and increased spending in the form of financial assistance to people affected by the pandemic.
